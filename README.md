# SolarStationR3

Solar Station based on the ESP32 with the ability to report data over HTTP/JSON and InfluxDB.

It spends most of its time in deep sleep and uses the ULP to track wind.


## Building 

You will need ESP-IDF version 3.3. All required libraries are bundled for convenience so a `make -j 8` should suffice. If you wish to use upstream libraries instead please note that the Arduino library has been patched for power savings.
